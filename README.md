# Project PMDM
Project realized during the 2ยบ year of Certificate of Higher Education in multiplatform coding
The project was oriented to creating a usual login/register application with a list that has
modification features in this case i created a films app where you can save/edit your films this
app was working against an Api that our teacher created for this project.

## Login Screen
![This was supposed to be the an image of the login screen](ReadmeImages/LoginScreen.png)

I made a simple design, the validation process works against the teachers api.
The login also has a link to the register screen

## Register Screen

Again a simple design, the register validation also works against the api.
From the register you can go back to the login.
### Validations before registering
- Check that the password has more than 8 characters and less that 16
- Check that the birthdate has date format
- Check that both password fields have the same content
